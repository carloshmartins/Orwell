## Design and goals

Orwell was first and foremost designed to be a powerful and heavily customizable Quicktime replacer.

While the goal is definitely also to make Orwell as accessible and easy to use as possible.

## Contributions and support

Orwell is developed completely in the open, and your contributions are more than welcome.

Before you start using Orwell in any of your projects, it’s highly recommended that you spend a few minutes familiarizing yourself with its documentation and internal implementation, so that you’ll be ready to tackle any issues or edge cases that you might encounter.

Since this is a very young project, it’s likely to have many limitations and missing features, which is something that can really only be discovered and addressed as more people start using it.

This project does not come with GitHub Issues-based support, and users are instead encouraged to become active participants in its continued development — by fixing any bugs that they encounter, or by improving the documentation wherever it’s found to be lacking.

If you wish to make a change, [open a Pull Request](https://github.com/JohnSundell/Orwell/pull/new) — even if it just contains a draft of the changes you’re planning, or a test that reproduces an issue — and we can discuss it further from there.

Hope you’ll enjoy using Orwell!
